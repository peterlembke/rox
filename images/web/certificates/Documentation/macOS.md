## macOS - Allow notifications

See [allow notifications](macos-allow-notifications.md)

## macOS - Use the certificate in Safari browser

Unfortunately no browser except Safari use this certificate.

Start Safari. Surf to https://dev.local/
Enjoy the trusted HTTPS and start developing with Javascript that only work with HTTPS, like notification API and much more.

## macOS - Firefox browser

Firefox have its own list with trusted certificates.
Go into settings and search for cert.
You can upload the dev.local.crt file and select full rights.
The file turn up as trusted in the Firefox list.
When you surf to https://dev.local/ it is still not trusted but the Notification API works anyhow.
